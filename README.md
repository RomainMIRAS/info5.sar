# Java Communication Layer
## Description
This repository contains resources and source code for the **info5.sar** project. This project aims to create multiple Java Socket designs/implementations based on Threaded or Event-driven models.

## Repository Structure
- **/task1**: Eclipse project containing Threaded Channel/Broker + Threaded Message Overlay
- **/task3**: Eclipse project containing Threaded Channel + Mixed Thread/Event Message Overlay
- **/task4**: Eclipse project containing Full Event Message Layer
- **/design**: Folder containing designs for each task.
- **/specification**: Folder containing specifications for each task.

*Note: Each Eclipse project contains a test package with an EchoServer class having a main method that tests the sockets with a simple send/receive test.*

## Branch Info

The main branch containing the latest version is the **main** branch.
Each task was implemented in order with the creation of a branch for each advancement stage: specification -> design -> implementation.
Tests are generally created in advance in the implementation branch.
